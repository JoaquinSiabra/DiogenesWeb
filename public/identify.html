  <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
  <p>
    DiogenesWeb does not use cookies or store any user information whatsoever on its server; all user information is kept in your browser's local storage.  Each time you access DiogenesWeb, the server logs the category of user (as identified above) making the request, nothing more.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you connect to the Dropbox website of your cloud storage provider (e.g. Dropbox), you have to enter your password.  DiogenesWeb never sees that password.  Your provider sends back a time-limited token that permits access only to the DiogenesWeb folder within your private storage.  That token is stored in your browser.

    If you would prefer not to say what category of user you belong to, <a id="none-button" onclick="setUser('none')"> click here</a>.
