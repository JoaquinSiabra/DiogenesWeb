  <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
  <p>
    DiogenesWeb does not use cookies or store any user information whatsoever on its server; all user information is kept in your browser's local storage.  Each time you access DiogenesWeb, the server logs the category of user, nothing more.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you connect to the website of your cloud storage provider, you will have to enter your password.  DiogenesWeb never sees that password; it goes directly to your cloud provider.  Your provider sends back a time-limited token that permits access only to the DiogenesWeb folder within your private storage.  That token is stored in your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would prefer not to say what category of user you belong to, <a id="none-button" onclick="setUser('none')"> click here</a>.
